# Corpus

This folder contains the text files used to train the program.

1. `MessyCorpus.txt`: This file contains the raw text used to train the program. If you want to use your own corpus, you can update this file.

2. `CleanCorpus.txt`: This file is the output of the cleaning and preprocessing of the messy corpus. It is generated by the [Corpus.java](https://github.com/obada-jaras/Arabic-Plagiarism-Detector-Using-NLP/blob/main/src/LanguageProcesses/Corpus.java) file.

3. `StemmedCorpus.txt`: This file is the clean corpus after applying stemming using the [Stemmer.py](https://github.com/obada-jaras/Arabic-Plagiarism-Detector-Using-NLP/blob/main/src/LanguageProcesses/Utils/PythonScripts/Stemmer.py) script.

Note: The corpus provided in this folder is a subset of data collected from Twitter and is intended for demonstration purposes. If you require a larger corpus for your research or project, please [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/obada-tahayna/) as I have access to a dataset of over 100 million Arabic tweets.
